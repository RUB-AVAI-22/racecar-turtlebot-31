1. **User Story: Set up the Basic Navigation System**
   - As a developer, I need to set up the Turtlebot with ROS2, ensuring that basic movement commands can be executed.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     1. Demonstrate that the Turtlebot can accept movement commands.
     2. The Turtlebot moves accurately according to sent commands (forward, backward, turn).

2. **User Story: Implement Sensor Integration for Obstacle Detection**
   - As a developer, I want to integrate the necessary sensors with the Turtlebot to enable obstacle detection.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     1. Sensors are correctly mounted and connected to the Turtlebot.
     2. The system can detect and report obstacles within a certain range.

3. **User Story: Develop Obstacle Avoidance Mechanisms**
   - As a developer, I want the Turtlebot to autonomously detect and avoid obstacles in its path.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     1. When encountering an obstacle, the Turtlebot should stop or navigate around it.
     2. The Turtlebot remains within operational boundaries while avoiding obstacles.

4. **User Story: Implement Mapping Capability**
   - As a developer, I want the Turtlebot to map its environment for improved navigation and awareness.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     1. The Turtlebot should create a detailed map of its surroundings.
     2. The map should update in real-time if the environment changes.

5. **User Story: Integrate Path Planning Algorithm**
   - As a developer, I want the Turtlebot to calculate the optimal path from point A to B without human intervention.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     1. The Turtlebot calculates the shortest available path.
     2. Path planning accounts for obstacles and avoids them.

6. **User Story: Develop User Interface for Monitoring**
   - As an operator, I want to monitor the Turtlebotâ€™s status and current operation through a user interface.
   - **Acceptance Criteria:**
     1. Display the Turtlebot's current status, including battery life, current task, and sensor status.
     2. Show a real-time updated map generated by the Turtlebot.
